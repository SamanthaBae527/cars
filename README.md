This repo contains a bash script named “cars.sh” that will help a user maintain an inventory of old cars.
 
 The user will be presented with a menu of three options:
# enter a car
You will enter the car's year, make, and model.
## display the list of cars
The program will list the cars in the My Old Cars text file.
### quit and exit the program
The program will end.
